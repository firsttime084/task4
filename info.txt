Detached HEAD State:
A “detached HEAD” state occurs when you check out a specific commit (usually by its hash or tag) instead of a branch.
In this state, you are not on any branch; you’re directly on a specific commit.
It’s common when viewing historical commits or working with tags.
However, you cannot make new commits directly in this state.
To exit the detached HEAD state, create a new branch or switch to an existing branch using git checkout.
